                         Dave Tiberi, President of Emergency Response Protocol LLP., announced today the launch of the company’s long awaited website: erpsafety.com.
“This is a very exciting moment for everyone here at ERP,” Tiberi stated. 
“I know many businesses, build their website, and then launch the business. We were challenged because when we first began promoting ERP the initial response was so overwhelming from organizations wishing to deploy the system, our web team found themselves tasked with getting these new clients up and running which of course was a much more important priority than building a website for our own company.”

                          It is not difficult for most people to understand the life-saving benefits offered by ERP in an event such as a hostage situation or fire, but ERP is rapidly earning high marks from insurance underwriters and risk managers for its ability to limit or prevent major property damage during more commonplace events.</p>

The Emergency Response Protocol ( E R P ) is a first responders orientation and mapping system from TNT Video, Multimedia and Television Productions, Inc. It is the ultimate tool for enhancing first responders reaction time and will provide police, fire and EMS personnel with critical visual and logistical information on schools, office buildings, industrial sites or virtually any location, instantly in the palm of their hands. <br />
For over 20 years, TNT Video has been working with major corporations, state and local governments and first responder groups producing life-savings audio-video tools covering a variety of scenarios. E R P is the evolutionary result of thousands of hours of research and development.<br />
Benefits of the Emergency Response Protocol ( E R P ) first responders orientation and mapping system:<br />
•	E R P provides first responders with an updateable visual 360 degree map of any building or location, both interior and exterior. This allows first responders to see exactly where an incident has occurred, the safest and quickest access to the incident as well as potential obstacles and threats which may exists. <br />
•	E R P provides logistical text information including items like: emergency contact lists, toxic or hazardous materials locations, access key codes, on-site personnel and virtually any other mission critical information. <br />
•	E R P can actually help reduce risks and in turn reduce insurance premiums. During the mapping and design phase of an E R P program, potential hazards and scenarios can be identified and corrected thus improving security and safety even before the system is deployed.<br /> 
•	E R P allows first responders to train and practice in the virtual reality setting without disturbing actual facility operations. <br />
•	E R P is easily and inexpensively updatable providing first responders with the most current information. In any emergency, time wasted can mean lives lost. E R P is designed to save time and  lives, reduce injuries and minimize property damage. <br />

 ‘Emergency’ is the first word in ERP and an emergency can take on many forms.<br /> 
The recent tragic shooting incident in an Arizona shopping center has spurred a debate over the heated political rhetoric of current times. But regardless of the motivation in that incident, security experts agree we are living in a period where individual or group violence is on the rise.<br /> 
As many companies continue to downsize to cope with the still stagnant economy, the possibility of a disturbed employee seeking retribution looms over companies large and small. The power of the Internet is apparent in the political movements sweeping the middle-east, but the same Internet and social networks have given rise to “flash mobs” and “spontaneous demonstrations” here at home. <br />
Many states are currently facing the reality of deep budgets cuts or certain insolvency. Both situations raise the specter of possible violent response. Meanwhile, police, fire and rescue department budgets  are being slashed.<br />
If one thing is apparent, it is that the threat of man-made emergencies is increasing and at a time when the manpower to deal with such events is stretched to its limits. 
ERP is the tool for the times offering first responders the vital information they need at their finger-tips to respond to virtually any emergency. ERP is the ultimate ‘force multiplier’ allowing one person instant access to real-time emergency response plans and the ability to assess and deploy the right response to the right location with full logistical awareness of the threats they face.

 It is not difficult for most people to understand the life-saving benefits offered by ERP in an event such as a hostage situation or fire, but ERP is rapidly earning high marks from insurance underwriters and risk managers for its ability to limit or prevent major property damage during more commonplace events. <br />
Two events in October of last year underscore how ERP’s many features can be used by not only first-responders but also building security and maintenance staff to save millions in property damage. <br />
In early October, the remnants of a tropical storm swept through the mid-Atlantic region generating pockets of tropical downpours in various locations; one such location was the regions popular King of Prussia Mall, northwest of Philadelphia.<br /> 
A biblical 10 inches of rain fell near the mall on October 1 creating an unprecedented flooding scenario that saw millions of gallons of water rushing into the Mall’s stores and food courts. The confusion, damage and recovery process created a huge logistical challenge.<br /> 
Barely three weeks later, a disturbed man started a small fire in the Roseville Mall near San Diego, CA. In the confusion that followed, a maintenance worker shut off the buildings water supply. With the massive complex’s sprinklers disabled, the fire rapidly spread and destroyed a landmark property leaving millions in damage and hundreds unemployed. 
In both cases, real and potential threats could have been minimized with the logistical awareness tools available in ERP. Reports indicated that there was concern over locating gas and electric cutoffs as the flood waters rose. In the Roseville Mall situation, the real-time interactive emergency plan component of ERP could have prevented the unnecessary water cutoff or, helped firefighters quickly realize the problem and reactivate the sprinkler system.<br />

 (Wilmington, DE) – Dave Tiberi, President of Emergency Response Protocol LLP., announced today the launch of the company’s long awaited website: erpsafety.com.
“This is a very exciting moment for everyone here at ERP,” Tiberi stated. <br />
“I know many businesses, build their website, and then launch the business. We were challenged because when we first began promoting ERP the initial response was so overwhelming from organizations wishing to deploy the system, our web team found themselves tasked with getting these new clients up and running which of course was a much more important priority than building a website for our own company.” <br />
Emergency Response Protocol is a state-of-art web-based logistical and situational awareness tool designed to provide instant access to first responders and facility staff in the event of nearly any conceivable emergency. <br />
“Erpsafety.com is not only designed to provide prospective clients a comprehensive overview on the features and benefits of the ERP Product, but we also want to make it a free on-line resource for everyone where key information on emergency response best practices can be shared,” Tiberi said.<Br />
“You cannot do this work and interact with all the emergency professionals without being infected by the mission that savings lives, regardless of business consideration, are your first priority. This is how we plan to develop erpsafety.com. Yes, we want to sell our product but where we can share general information on strategies that can protect first responders and save lives we are going to put in on the website. I urge everyone to take a few minutes and check out the site and most importantly to bookmark it so they can come back as often as needed for the latest information, news and tips on improving safety in their facilities.”

 ISO, the International Organization for Standardization is known for its detailed and technical research in establishing standards in many fields. ISO-92 is an evolving and comprehensive set of standards around fire safety, designed primarily for engineers and architects. But you do not need to be an engineer or architect to appreciate how these five objectives are universally applicable as an excellent starting point when creating an emergency plan for almost any emergency situation. <br />
The five ISO-92 Objectives are:<br />
1.	Preservation of Life<br/>
2.	Preservation of Property<br/>
3.	Continuity of Operations<br />
4.	Environmental Impact <br/>
5.	Preservation of Historical Heritage <br/> 
Obviously the top priority in any emergency planning is the prevention of the loss of lives. This objective also includes item four (environmental impact) where the threat to the environment posses an immediate or long-term threat to public health and safety.  But many Emergency Plans stop at preservation of life without taking the next logical step which is preservation of property. A damaged or destroyed facility can mean temporary or permanent job loss, a loss of critical tax revenue or in the case of a public facility, a major disruption in the delivery of public services. <br />
Many facilities like hospitals, water treatment plants, and critical manufacturing centers must incorporate a continuity of operations plan into their overall emergency planning. But all facilities serve some purpose and when an emergency prevents that facility from performing its purpose there is often a disruption which impacts the quality of life for some segment of the population.   Failure to plan for non-life threatening damage to the environment can destroy future use and value (real and aesthetic) of a location. <br />
While ISO-92’s historical preservation objective is primarily focused on buildings, historical reservation can also include both paper and digital records which could be vital for a corporation, government agency or any institution’s continuing operation.<br /> 
Life, Property, Continuity, Environment and History should all carry some consideration in a truly comprehensive emergency plan.

 (Wilmington, DE) – Dave Tiberi, President of Emergency Response Protocol LLP., announced today that Jesse Gledhill has joined the ERP Team. 
“When we began interviewing for Jesses’ position as Director of Programming and Photography, some people told me I would be lucky to find one person with a blend of the technical knowledge of a programmer and the artistic eye needed to make the ERP panoramic photography truly useable.  Jesse is not merely proficient in both areas but has that unique ability to integrate the two which is an essential aspect of ERP’s functionality.” Tiberi stated. <br />
Jessie, a 2010 Bachelor of Science in Information Systems Graduate of University of Delaware uses his impressive background in systems, analytics and problem solving to make ERP the cutting-edge standard in logistical emergency management software. <br />
“I have enjoyed the great opportunity to work with a number of special projects and organizations to bring the latest software technologies to today’s problems. This work has spanned groups from General Motors to Charter Schools,” Gledhill said. <br />
“With ERP, my focus is to use the latest and best behind-the-scenes programming to create easy to operate user interfaces. It always important to remember that our product is designed for use in a stress filled environment. Vital information needs to be up-front and available with one or two simple mouse clicks.” <br />
