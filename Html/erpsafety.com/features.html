            <p>At ERP, we apply the full "Situational Awareness Doctrine" in every system. The science of situational awareness is the same cutting edge protocol used by the United States Secret Service and other top-level security providers.</p>
            <p>By applying a Situational Awareness mindset from the design phase, ERP can better determine the correct technology and proper deployment of every component in your security system. Situational Awareness considers the application of security in a dynamic situation where conditions are constantly changing and the system must respond and function in those changing conditions.</p> 
            <p>ERP's trademark Emergency Management software tool provides a reputation for depth, experience and subject matter expertise. Its successful deployment in several large major public facilities shows clients that ERP is not simply another residential/small business installer but a professional full-service provider.</p> 
            <p>Of the 46 licensed central station monitoring companies, only three are shown as based in the State of Delaware. ERP's ability to provide a locally based monitoring center assures prospective clients of access and familiarity with monitored locations.</p>
