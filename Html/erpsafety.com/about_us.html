                <p>Emergency Response Protocol (ERP) was founded in 2007 by Angela Tiberi and is a qualified Women Owned Business.</p> 
                <p>For over 20 years Angela had worked alongside her husband Dave Tiberi as co-owner of TNT Video, Multimedia and Television Productions.</p> 
                <p>During this time, Angela served as director and producer of numerous safety and training videos as well as instructional CD-ROMS and web-based tutorials.</p>

                <div class="col span_3_of_12_about">
                <p>Through this experience Angela began to appreciate the need for a dynamic interactive tool for first-responders which would provide them vital situational awareness in the field.</p> 
                <p>This led to the development and release of ERP's landmark Emergency Management software application now in use at schools, universities and other facilities throughout the area.</p>
                <p>ERP incorporates the latest technology and the best practices in the industry, from conception and design to comprehensive ongoing maintenance and modernization.</p>

                <p>We believe each client and each situation is unique and one size NEVER fits everyone! We also believe when it comes to Total Security Solutions our clients deserve nothing less!</p>
                <p>A well designed system only works if you chose the proper equipment, the proper equipment is useless without quality professional installation and a solid commitment to service.</p>
